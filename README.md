React Laravel Assessment for the 3rd FaveTech Assessment

A movie booking app made using ReactJS for frontend and Laravel for the backend!

# Introduction

As part of the 3rd assessment for the Fave TechHub program, we were required to make a simple movie booking app using ReactJS for frontend and Laravel for the backend!

# Reflection
We actually spent less time coding, more time actually spend discussing planning the app flow and going the codes.
Overall, this was a very enjoyable assessment / project for both of us.

Things that we could have done better:

- Structure the code better.
- Fully reading documentation of packages before using them.
- Asked people for help earlier if I was stuck or dealt with unfamiliar syntax.
- Improve the code (eg: tidy, change code name etc.)
- Combine Movie Page Client with Booking Page Client.
- Change booking page UI to fit homepage design.
- And ALOT MORE!!
